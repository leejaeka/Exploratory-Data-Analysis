This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
setwd('D:/Project/R Scripts/Exploratory-Data-Analysis/Udacity+Facebook')
#install.packages('GGally')
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
library(tidyverse)
library(GGally)
```
```{r}
wine <- read.csv('wineQualityWhites.csv')

set.seed(42)
wine_subset <- wine[, c(2:13)]
names(wine_subset)
ggpairs(wine_subset[sample.int(nrow(wine_subset), 1000), ])
```



















Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
